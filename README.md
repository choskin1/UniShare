## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account:** The application is currently deployed using AWS services, including EC2, S3, and RDS. If you wish to modify or redeploy the application, you'll need an AWS account. Sign up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **Amazon Academy Learner Lab Credentials:** Access to the current deployment is through Amazon Academy Learner Lab credentials. Ensure you have these credentials handy.

- **Git:** To clone and manage the project repository.

- **Basic Knowledge of Cloud Services:** Familiarity with AWS services such as EC2, S3, and RDS will be beneficial.

- **Internet Connection:** To access cloud services and deploy the application.


## Installation & Setup

### 1. Setting up the EC2 for Web Server

1. **Launch an EC2 instance** on AWS and ensure it's running.
2. **SSH into the EC2 instance** using your preferred terminal or SSH client:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip
3. **Clone the UniShare repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/choskin1/UniShare.git
4. **Navigate to the cloned repository** and run the frontend startup script:
   ```bash
   cd UniShare
   ./setup-frontend.sh
5. This will start the main Python application and create a server operating on port `5001`.

### 2. Setting up the RDS for Database

1. **Launch an RDS instance** on AWS:
   - Navigate to the RDS service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose the database engine (e.g., MySQL).
   - Configure the instance specifications, security groups, and other settings as needed.
   - Launch the RDS instance and note down the endpoint.
2. **SSH into your EC2 instance** (if not already connected):
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip
3. **Install the MySQL client on the EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install mysql
4. **Connect to the RDS database from the EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -u your-username -p
5. **Create a database named `myappdb`**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE myappdb;
   USE myappdb;
6. **Run the database setup script to configure the tables and other database structures**:
   ```sql
   SOURCE setup-database.sql;
7. **Verify the database setup by checking the tables**:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   EXIT;

### 3. Setting up the S3 Bucket
